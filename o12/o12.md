# Assignment 1
### Vulnerability
SQL-injection by barcode:
```sql
1554949;UPDATE products set price = 1 WHERE 1=1;
```
The barcode has the encoding of code-128, and we generate a barcode containing our
exploit-string using this encoding.

### Solution
Suggested solution would be to not append sting directly to select statement.
Preferably by using an established sql-library that has this built in 
or implement it yourself. django.db has this implemented in its connection objects f.ex.

# Assignment 2:
We get the offset by looking at the type of system we are dealing with, or 
we can simply check in Ghidra under the display bytes option.
- x: 32 + 8, buffer overflow + nearest function call
- %ee%06%40%00%00%00%00%00: address of print_flags + offset, accounting for Endianness
using % for correct string formatting.

The final string to receive the flag (insert directly into url to avoid encoding-issues):

_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%ee%06%40%00%00%00%00%00_
